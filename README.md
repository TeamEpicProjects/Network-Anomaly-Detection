NOTE - While extracting the datasets from their respective zip files, change the extension of the extracted files to '.csv'. Once extracted, move these files in a folder named 'dataset' and rename the 10% dataset csv and full dataset csv as 'sample_data' and 'data' respectively. 
      The dataset folder should be stored in the same location as the python notebook.
